## Unsolved Problems

-  The idea is to have multiple choices each day for users to choose.
-  I would like for users to leave reviews for each day's menu.
-  I would like to have a chef's profile, clicking on their profile would
   show their menu.
-  Right now, the menu page is seed data. I would love for chefs to sign up
   and upload their menus.
-  Stripe is not implemented, cash on delivery for now!

## User Stories

As a user, I can
  -  sign up
  -  sign in
  -  change password
  -  sign out
  -  Check out the daily offering.
  -  Order food for the next three days.
  -  Cancel my order(s).
  -  Click the like button if the menu looks interesting.
